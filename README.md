# Building a hugo site and theme with Bootstrap

Following Will Schenk's wonderfully concise and refreshing blog post [Building a hugo site and theme with Bootstrap](https://willschenk.com/articles/2018/building-a-hugo-site/) from "way back when" in 2018 (still works like a charm).

That's a tribute really both to Will Schenk ([crazy Blog](https://willschenk.com/) and to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). And to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)!

Follow step by step (commit by commit) to see how to integrate Bootstrap into your own Hugo theme. Including (hold on to your hats and Roma masks)... hot reloading Sass integration!

Would benefit greatly by using a monorepo *a la Gatsby theme* in actual practice.

Did this for my own edification, any errors or omissions are my own.
